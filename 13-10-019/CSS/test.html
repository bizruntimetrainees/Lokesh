        Iron Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published 
        by Marvel Comics. The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, 
        developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack 
        Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover 
        dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968). 

        A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, 
        Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. 
        When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, 
        he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. 
        Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he 
        designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive 
        versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true 
        identity, Stark eventually declared that he was, in fact, Iron Man in a public announcement.
